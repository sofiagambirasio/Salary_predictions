# Salary_predictions
In this project I have imported the following [dataset on annual salary](Salary_Data_Based_country_and_race.csv) for a series of person, specifying individual socio-demographic characteristics. 

### Preprocessing and exploratory analysis 
*Python on Jupyter Notebook*
In the following [Jupyter Notebook file](salaries_ml_py.ipynb) I have imported the dataset, cleaned it and went through all variables to see if they were relevant in predicting the Salary and, if so, prepared them for the subsequent application of machine learning algorithms. 
Lastly I have exported the [modified dataset](salary_mod.csv).

### Predictions using machine learning 
*R markdown*
I import the modified dataset in R studio and proceed to perform machine learning predictions and evaluating them. The results and comments are in the following [R markdown file](salaries_ml_r.pdf)
